Notes about using API

- There should be a very clear starting point
- Getting started should link to something I can try out asap
    - Either a client lib with a getting started tutorial
    - Or an interative example
- Real examples I can copy and paste would be super useful (this applies mainly to client libs I suppose)
    - in the vein of a 'picture is worth a thousand words', it explains a lot of small details very quickly
- It'd be nice if the api page had a different icon because I associate the trello icon with something else entirely so my eye skips it automatically
